## Ideas:

- Changing personality/strategy

- Shuffling position

- Running multiple cells as different "teams"

## To Do List:
Meeting 02/23 (Ben, Gian, Hanshi, Ashok)
- [x] Fix wealth transaction
- [x] Fix color assignmnent
- [ ] Find data to analyze
- [ ] Mutating personality
- [ ] Remove unnecessary code

Meeting 02/28 (Ben, Gian, Ashok, Prof.Nair)
- [ ] Identify the interaction mechanism (understand the Von Neumann interaction order)
- [ ] Bring back the score to base 100 after every tick (normalizing)
- [ ] Probability of co-operating behavior will not be random (Red may not be willing to interact with red as much as blue would like to interact with blue). Rethink the co-operating behavior generation at spawn
- [ ] Recode the colors to Green, White, Yellow and Red
- [ ] Segregating the interactions to limit to teams
- [ ] Add the exchange rate slider
- [ ] Capturing the color of neighbors of each turtle
- [ ] Plan the variables to be collected in Behavior Space (current wealth, new wealth, current color, new color, exchange rate, mutuation rate). What are the x and y variables?
- [ ] Tracking grid level and turtle level wealth change in every tick
- [ ] Add mutation rate as a variable
- [ ] (Future) Add personality change options based on triggers (e.g. 5 continous ticks as red will force a non-cooperating person to co-operate with others)
